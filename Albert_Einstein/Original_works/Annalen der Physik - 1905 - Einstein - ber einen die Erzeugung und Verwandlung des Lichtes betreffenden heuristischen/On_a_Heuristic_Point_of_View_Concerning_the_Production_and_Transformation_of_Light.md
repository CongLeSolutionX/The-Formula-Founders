# üå°Ô∏è ¬ß1-2: Black-Body Radiation and Planck's Quanta

Einstein starts by acknowledging the success of Maxwell's theory for optical phenomena like reflection and refraction but points out its limitations when dealing with the interaction of light and matter, specifically black-body radiation.

**Classical Dilemma (Ultraviolet Catastrophe):**  
Classical physics (Rayleigh-Jeans Law) predicted that a black body should emit infinite energy at high frequencies. This was obviously wrong!

**Planck's Breakthrough (1900):**  
Max Planck resolved this by postulating that energy is exchanged in discrete packets, or quanta. Einstein takes this further.

**Planck's Radiation Law (as cited by Einstein, p. 136):**  
For the energy density $\rho_{\nu}$ of radiation in equilibrium with resonators at temperature $T$:

$$
\rho_{\nu} = \frac{\alpha \nu^3}{e^{\frac{\beta \nu}{T}} - 1}
$$

Where $\alpha = 6.10 \times 10^{-56}$ and $\beta = 4.866 \times 10^{-11}$ are constants (in cgs units used in the paper).  
Einstein notes that for large wavelengths or high temperatures (small $\nu/T$), this approximates to (Rayleigh-Jeans form):

$$
\rho_{\nu} \approx \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \nu^2 T
$$

Comparing this with the classical derivation, Einstein calculates Avogadro's number $N$ (p. 137):

$$
N = \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \frac{8 \pi R}{L^3} = 6.17 \times 10^{23}
$$

(using $R$ as the ideal gas constant and $L$ as the speed of light, although $L$ is usually $c$). In the paper, $L$ is often used for light speed.

The crucial link is $\frac{R}{N} \beta = h$ (Planck's constant). Einstein's central idea is that these "energy elements" are not just a feature of matter's interaction with radiation but are inherent properties of light itself.

# üé≤ ¬ß3-6: Entropy, Boltzmann's Principle, and the Light Quantum Hypothesis

Einstein uses a powerful analogy based on entropy and statistical mechanics to argue for the "particle-like" nature of light. He considers monochromatic radiation of low density (where Wien's approximation of Planck's law is valid).

**Wien's Radiation Law (approximation for low density / high frequency $\nu$, p. 139):**

$$
\rho = \alpha \nu^3 e^{-\frac{\beta \nu}{T}}
$$

**Entropy of Monochromatic Radiation (from Wien's law, p. 139):**  
The entropy $\varphi$ per unit volume and frequency interval is given as:

$$
\varphi(\rho, \nu) = -\frac{\rho}{\beta \nu} \left\{ \lg \frac{\rho}{\alpha \nu^3} - 1 \right\}
$$

For a total energy $E$ of radiation of frequency $\nu$ in a volume $V$, so $\rho = E/V$. The change in total entropy $S = V\varphi$ when the volume changes from $V_0$ to $V$ (keeping $E, \nu$ constant) is:

$$
S - S_0 = \frac{E}{\beta \nu} \lg \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)
$$

**Analogy with an Ideal Gas:**  
This equation has the exact same form as the entropy change for an ideal gas of $n$ particles expanding from $V_0$ to $V$:

$$
S - S_0 = n k_B \lg \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)
$$

(where $k_B = R/N_A$ is Boltzmann's constant).

Comparing these, Einstein suggests that the radiation behaves as if it consists of $n_q$ independent energy quanta, where:

$$
n_q = \frac{E}{\beta \nu} \frac{N}{R} = \frac{E}{h \nu}
$$

(since $h = \frac{R}{N}\beta$).

**Boltzmann's Principle ($S = k \log W$):**  
Einstein then invokes Boltzmann's principle, which relates entropy $S$ to the statistical probability $W$ of a system's state. For $n_q$ independent particles (light quanta) originally in volume $V_0$, the probability of all $n_q$ particles randomly being found in a sub-volume $V$ is:

$$
W = \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)^{n_q}
$$

Using Boltzmann's principle $S - S_0 = \frac{R}{N} \lg W$ (as stated on p.141, using $R/N$ effectively as Boltzmann's constant $k_B$), substituting $W$:

$$
S - S_0 = \frac{R}{N} n_q \lg \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)
$$

Substituting $n_q = \frac{E N}{R \beta \nu}$:

$$
S - S_0 = \frac{R}{N} \left( \frac{E N}{R \beta \nu} \right) \lg \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right) = \frac{E}{\beta \nu} \lg \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)
$$

This matches the entropy equation derived from Wien's law! üéâ This powerful analogy suggests light, at least under these conditions, behaves like a collection of independent, localized energy quanta. Each quantum carries energy $E_{quantum} = \frac{R}{N}\beta\nu = h\nu$.

# ‚ú® ¬ß7: Stokes' Rule

Stokes' rule in photoluminescence states that the wavelength of emitted light is usually longer than (or equal to) the wavelength of the absorbed light that excites the luminescence. In terms of frequency ($\nu = c/\lambda$):  
$$ \nu_{emitted} \le \nu_{absorbed} $$  
Einstein provides a simple explanation using light quanta (p. 144):  
If an incident light quantum of energy $\frac{R}{N}\beta\nu_1$ is absorbed and a new light quantum of energy $\frac{R}{N}\beta\nu_2$ is emitted (some energy might be converted to other forms like heat), then by energy conservation:
$$
\frac{R}{N}\beta\nu_2 \le \frac{R}{N}\beta\nu_1
$$
$$
\implies \nu_2 \le \nu_1
$$
This is precisely Stokes' rule.

# üí° ¬ß8: The Photoelectric Effect

This is perhaps the most famous application of Einstein's light quantum hypothesis. The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a material when light shines on it. Classical wave theory had difficulties explaining several observed features:
1.  **Intensity:** Classical theory predicted that brighter light (higher intensity) should eject electrons with higher kinetic energy. Experimentally, higher intensity ejects *more* electrons, but their maximum kinetic energy is unchanged.
2.  **Frequency Threshold:** Classical theory predicted that any frequency of light, if intense enough, should be able to eject electrons. Experimentally, there's a minimum (threshold) frequency $\nu_0$ below which no electrons are emitted, no matter how intense the light.
3.  **No Time Lag:** Classical theory suggested a delay as electrons absorb enough energy from a continuous wave. Experimentally, emission is nearly instantaneous.

**Einstein's Quantum Explanation (p. 145-147):**  
He proposed that light of frequency $\nu$ consists of quanta, each with energy $h\nu$ (using $h = \frac{R}{N}\beta$). When a quantum strikes an electron in the metal:
*   The electron absorbs the entire quantum's energy $h\nu$.
*   A part of this energy, $P$ (the work function), is used to overcome the binding forces holding the electron in the material.
*   The remaining energy appears as the maximum kinetic energy ($\Pi_e$) of the emitted electron.

**The Photoelectric Equation (p. 146):**
$$
\Pi_e = \frac{R}{N} \beta \nu - P
$$
Or, more commonly written today as:
$$
K.E._{max} = h \nu - \Phi
$$
($\Phi$ is the work function, equivalent to $P$).

This beautifully explains the experimental observations:
1.  **Intensity:** Higher intensity means more quanta, so more electrons are ejected, but each quantum still has energy $h\nu$, so $K.E._{max}$ is unchanged.
2.  **Frequency Threshold:** For an electron to be emitted, its $K.E._{max}$ must be $>0$. So, $h\nu > \Phi$. The threshold frequency is $\nu_0 = \Phi/h$. If $\nu < \nu_0$, no single quantum has enough energy to eject an electron.
3.  **No Time Lag:** Energy is transferred in discrete lumps (quanta), not continuously. If a quantum has enough energy, emission is immediate.

Einstein cites Lenard's experiments (e.g., P. Lenard, Ann. d. Phys. 8. p. 169 u. 170. 1902) showing that the kinetic energy of emitted electrons is independent of light intensity and depends on the light's nature (frequency). He uses Lenard's data to estimate values.

----

# ‚ö° ¬ß9: Ionization of Gases by Ultraviolet Light

Einstein briefly applies the quantum concept to the ionization of gases by UV light (p. 148). If $J$ is the energy required to ionize a gas molecule, then a light quantum can cause ionization only if its energy is sufficient:
$$
\frac{R}{N} \beta \nu \ge J
$$
Or, $h\nu \ge J$. This explains why there's a minimum frequency (maximum wavelength) for UV light to ionize a particular gas.

----

# üéØ Conclusion of Einstein's Paper

Einstein concludes by emphasizing the heuristic nature of his viewpoint. He argues that if the entropy dependence of monochromatic radiation on volume (for low densities) is given by the formula he derived (analogous to an ideal gas or dilute solution), then it seems natural to link this to the idea that the energy of light is discontinuously distributed in space.

This paper was revolutionary because it proposed that light itself is quantized, not just its interaction with matter. This was a radical departure from the classical wave theory of light and laid essential groundwork for quantum mechanics. For this work, particularly his explanation of the photoelectric effect, Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. üèÜ
